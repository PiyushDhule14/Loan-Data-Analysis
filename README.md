# Loan-Data-Analysis
The largest online loan marketplace specializes in facilitating personal, business, and medical procedure financing through a user-friendly online platform. However, like many lenders, its primary financial challenge stems from credit loss, primarily caused by defaulted loans, labeled as 'charged-off.' To mitigate this risk, the company aims to identify high-risk loan applicants through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). By pinpointing these risky borrowers, the company can reduce the issuance of such loans, ultimately minimizing credit loss and bolstering financial stability.
